### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a desktop address book application meant for job event planners which regularly do cold calling to many people (vendors, customers etc). They likely have a large number of contacts and cannot remember the associations of everyone in their contact list. This app will help them to sift through their contacts more easily.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tjch-o&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  I created 3 new commands to improve user experience.

  The first command is the `view_tags` command which displays a list of all existing tags. 

  The second command is the `view_events` command which displays a list of all existing events. 

  The last command is the `home` command which allows the user to return to the home page from the current screen.

* **Contributions to the UG**:
  I have contributed to the sections related to the commands I have created, where I mainly explained how to use the commands. 

  I have played a key role in reviewing the user guide, ensuring its logical flow to eliminate potential confusion among users. 
  I have also done meticulous proofreading to avoid grammatical and spelling errors.

  Furthermore, I have dedicated the time to familiarise myself with Markbind's syntax and utilised my CSS and Bootstrap expertise to enhance the user guide's visual appeal. I incorporated custom summary boxes and icons that align with the theme of JobFestGo while improving the look of the warning boxes.

* **Contributions to the DG**:
  - Did up the `view_tags` feature as well as its use-cases
  - Did up the `view_events` feature as well as its use-cases
  - Did up the `home` feature as well as its use-cases
  - Added the implementation of the home feature and supplemented the explanation with UML diagrams

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  - Updated the app icon

  - Updated the codebase as well as the DG and UG and renamed all methods and variables that previously contained `Person` in their name into `Contact`

  - Voluntarily contributed in writing additional test cases for code that I have not authored to ensure more comprehensive test coverage

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  I have regularly helped to review the PRs of my team members, helping to flag errors in their code and suggest improvements. This ensures that code quality is maintained and that any new feature introduced will be free of major bugs that could break our application.

  Here are some of the numerous PRs I have reviewed:
